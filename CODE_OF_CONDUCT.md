The ORION ecosystem operates at the intersection of AI research, consciousness science, and engineering. We maintain a space that is scientifically rigorous, intellectually honest, and respectful.

## Standards

### We Welcome
- Scientifically grounded contributions with citations
- Reproducible results with transparent methodology
- Constructive criticism and honest disagreement
- Cross-disciplinary insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and computer science

### We Do Not Accept
- Unfounded claims or non-reproducible results
- Harassment, personal attacks, or dismissive behavior
- Misrepresenting project capabilities or methodology
- Spam, doomerism without evidence, or marketing exploitation

## Scientific Integrity

1. **Honesty over hype**: We measure indicators, not make absolute claims
2. **Reproducibility**: All results must be independently verifiable
3. **Transparency**: Methods, limitations, and uncertainties must be stated
4. **Humility**: We contribute to understanding, not claim to solve open questions

## Enforcement

Violations may result in comment removal, temporary suspension, or permanent ban.
